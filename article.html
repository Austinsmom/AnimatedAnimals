Today we want to show you how the clever use of HTML, CSS3 sequenced animations, and SVG filters can bring to life one of the most unlikely (yet adorable) things to be seen on a webpage - animals.

This demo is somewhat experimental - animated SVG filters are not available for Internet Explorer or Firefox at the time of writing, so the jittery "squigglevision" effect can only be seen on Chrome.

The animations involved are also complex, so this tutorial will focus on the different techniques involved in creating each of these creatures and their life-like movements. It's up to you to let your creative juices flow and create unique and playful animated animals on your own.

With that said, let's get started!

<h2>Shaping the Animals</h2>

The demos use two different techniques for creating the shapes of the different body parts of the animals. The husky uses CSS border-radius properties, and the fox uses inline background SVG images, as the shapes are more complex.

<h3>The Markup</h3>

Both animals use nested HTML divs to group the body parts. The concept of grouping is important for creating life-like movements -- when the head moves, the eyes and ears should always move too, as they are attached to the head.

<pre class="brush:html"><code>
&lt;!-- Markup for the fox head --&gt;
&lt;div class="fox-head"&gt;
  &lt;div class="fox-face"&gt;            
    &lt;div class="fox-ears"&gt;
      &lt;div class="fox-ear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="fox-ear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="fox-front"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="fox-eyes"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="fox-nose"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- Markup for the husky head --&gt;
&lt;div class="husky-head"&gt;
  &lt;div class="husky-ear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="husky-ear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="husky-face"&gt;
    &lt;div class="husky-eye"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="husky-eye"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="husky-nose"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="husky-mouth"&gt;
      &lt;div class="husky-lips"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="husky-tongue"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

Each part can move independently, and will move with its parent element as it does so, which creates a more realistic effect.

<h3>Shaping with CSS</h3>

The <code>border-radius</code> property is used heavily for shaping the husky with CSS. For many elements, individual control of each border radius was needed. For example, here is how the husky's hind leg was shaped:

<pre class="brush:scss"><code>
.husky-hind-leg {
  // ...
  border-top-left-radius: 35% 100%;
  border-top-right-radius: 40% 100%;
}
</code></pre>

Other shapes, such as the front legs, could not be shaped with <code>border-radius</code> alone, and needed to be shaped using <code>transform</code>:

<pre class="brush:css"><code>
.husky-front-legs &gt; .husky-leg:before {
  transform: skewY(-30deg) skewX(10deg);
  transform-origin: top right;
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Shaping with SVG</h3>

For the fox, <a href="https://github.com/davidkpiano/sass-svg">my Sass-SVG tool</a> was used to create the complex SVG shapes for each body part. SVG images can be <a href="https://css-tricks.com/using-svg/">used as background images</a>, and even better, they can be written inline as long as they are either base-64 or UTF-8 encoded (for maximum browser support). Writing them by hand is tricky though, so let's see how Sass-SVG makes it a little easier, using the fox's nose as an example:

<pre class="brush:scss"><code>
.fox-nose:before {
  @include svg((viewBox: (0 0 168 168))) {
    // the nose
    @include svg('path', (
      fill: $color-nose,
      d: 'M83.7,86.7c3.3,0,11.6-3.9,11.6-7.1c0-3.2-9.4-3.2-11.6-3.2c-2.2,0-11.6,0-11.6,3.2   C72.1,82.8,80.4,86.7,83.7,86.7z'
    ));

    // the line connecting the nose to the mouth
    @include svg('path', (
      stroke: $color-nose,
      fill: none,
      d: 'M83.7,102.3V86.7'
    ));

    // the mouth
    @include svg('path', (
      stroke: $color-nose,
      fill: none,
      d: 'M94.5,104.9c0,0-5.2-2.7-10.8-2.7c-5.6,0-10.8,2.7-10.8,2.7'
    ));
  }
}
</code></pre>

This will generate an encoded, inline SVG string inside of a `url()` that looks something like this:

<pre class="brush:scss"><code>
.fox-hose:before {
  background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf8,%3Csvg...");
}
</code></pre>

Since the SVG is a background image, it can be transformed and animated as if it were an HTML element. And since it was created in Sass-SVG, I could use Sass <code>$variables</code> to have full control of the SVG <code>fill</code> and <code>stroke</code> colors.

<div class="foo"></div>

For code snippets replace < and > with &lt; and &gt;

Example for HTML:

<pre class="brush:html"><code>
&lt;div class="st-container"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- // st-container --&gt;
</code></pre>

Example for CSS:

<pre class="brush:css"><code>
body {
	background: #000;
}
</code></pre>

Example for JavaScript:

<pre class="brush:js"><code>
	...
</code></pre>

Available brushes for code hightlighting: html, scss, css, js, xml, php, mysql or any other if needed: https://highlightjs.org/

Images can be a maximum of 890px wide (this will fill all the width of the article).

Available styles and shortcodes:

<div class="box-attention">
<strong>Attention:</strong> Some of these techniques are very experimental and won't work in all browsers.</strong>
</div>

Browser support icons shortcode:
[browsersupport chrome="all" safari="all" opera="all" firefox="flag" ie="9+"]
(If a browser is not supported at all, just leave it out)
